⚽ Premier League Match Performance Analysis (2024/2025) 📌 Project Overview
Football is more than just goals and results — it is about performance, patterns, and small details that make the difference on the pitch.

This project analyses match data from the Premier League 2024/2025 season to better understand how teams perform across the season. Using Python and data analysis techniques, the project looks at match results, goals, points, and home vs away performance.

The goal is to turn raw football data into clear and meaningful insights, just like analysing a match after the final whistle.

🏟️ Dataset Description

The dataset contains match-level data from the Premier League 2024/2025 season.

Each row represents one football match, including:

Home team and away team

Goals scored

Match result

Points awarded to each team

The data is well structured and consistent, which makes it suitable for analysis without heavy cleaning.

🧠 What This Project Looks At

This analysis focuses on key football questions, such as:

Do teams perform better at home?

How are points distributed across teams?

What patterns appear in match results?

How goal differences affect outcomes

Each step is explained clearly, using simple language, so the insights are easy to follow — even for someone without a technical background.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python – for data analysis

Pandas – to clean and manipulate match data

Matplotlib / Seaborn – to create visualisations

Jupyter Notebook – to combine code, analysis, and explanations

These tools help break down complex football data into easy-to-understand visuals and results.

📊 Key Insights

Some clear patterns emerged from the analysis:

Home teams tend to perform better than away teams

There are noticeable differences in how teams collect points

Match outcomes are strongly influenced by goals scored and goal difference

These insights reflect real football behaviour that fans often see during the season.

🏁 Conclusion

This project shows how football data can be used to better understand match performance and results. By analysing Premier League matches from the 2024/2025 season, meaningful patterns and insights were discovered.

Just like breaking down a game after watching Match of the Day, this analysis turns numbers into a clear football story.

🙌 Final Note

This project was created as a capstone project and reflects both technical skills and a personal interest in football. The aim was not just to analyse data, but to make the results easy to understand and enjoyable to read.
