⚽ Premier League Match Performance Analysis (Capstone Project)
📌 Project Overview

This project analyses Premier League football matches to understand team performance, match results, and goal patterns using data.

The main aim of the project is to explore how teams perform across a season and what factors influence match outcomes.

The project focuses only on the Premier League.

❓ Project Questions

This project was built to answer the following questions:

How do matches usually end in the Premier League?
(Home win, draw, or away win)

How many goals are scored in Premier League matches?
Both in total and on average per match.

Which teams perform best during the season?
Based on points, goals, and match results.

Is there a home advantage in the Premier League?
Do teams perform better at home than away?

How does team performance change between home and away matches?
Comparing goals scored and points earned.

Are matches generally high-scoring or low-scoring?
Looking at goal patterns and match outcomes.

Can data help explain differences in team playing styles?
For example, attacking teams vs more defensive teams.

These questions guide the analysis and help turn raw data into clear football insights.

❓ Why the Premier League?

The Premier League is:

one of the most competitive football leagues

rich in match data

ideal for analysing goals, results, and team performance

By focusing on one league only, the analysis stays clear, fair, and meaningful.

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains match-level data from a Premier League season.

Each row represents one football match, including:

home and away teams

goals scored at half-time and full-time

match outcome (home win, draw, away win)

points awarded

goal difference

The dataset is well structured and suitable for data analysis and visualisation.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Python (pandas, matplotlib)

Jupyter Notebook – for data cleaning and analysis

Power BI – for interactive dashboards and visual insights

GitHub – for version control and project sharing

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The analysis was carried out in a Jupyter Notebook.

Key areas explored include:

distribution of match outcomes

total and average goals per match

team performance across the season

comparison of home and away results

Each chart includes a short explanation and a clear insight, written in simple language.

📈 Power BI Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to present the analysis visually.

Dashboard Pages:

League Overview – total matches, goals, and outcomes

Team Performance – team comparison based on points

Goals & Match Insights – goal patterns and results

Home vs Away Performance – home advantage analysis

Additional Insights – supporting summaries

Filters and slicers allow users to interact with the data and focus on specific teams.

📌 Key Insights

Some of the main findings from the project:

Home teams generally earn more points than away teams

Matches with more goals often result in clear outcomes

Team performance differs strongly between home and away games

The Premier League shows strong competition across teams

These insights match real football behaviour in the league.

🎯 Conclusion

This project shows how data analytics can be used to analyse football performance in a clear and practical way.

By combining:

Python-based analysis

clear visualisations

interactive Power BI dashboards

the project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow, from raw data to insights.
